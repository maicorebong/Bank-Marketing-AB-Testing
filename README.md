# Bank Marketing A/B Testing

This project utilized SAS and basic exploratory data analysis queries along with statistical methods to examine group characteristics and their corresponding responses. It focuses on analyzing the effectiveness of two marketing campaigns (Group A and Group B) through an A/B test with the main objective to identify factors that influence customer conversion and determine which campaign drives better results.

A dataset of 1,500 customers who were part of the A/B test were utilized with the primary variable being customer response to the bank’s offer. The key data variables analyzed include:
- group: campaign group (A or B) each customer received
- response: whether the customer responded to the offer (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
- balance: customer’s account balance
- age
- job: customer's occupation, with categories like Admin, Blue-Collar, Entrepreneur, Retired, Student, and Technician
- marital: customer’s marital status (Divorced, Married, Single)

Statistical tests like t-tests, ANOVA, GLM, and logistic regression were used to evaluate the data. Gathered insights will help the bank optimize future campaigns by targeting the right customer segments.
